    <!-- <p>(I look forward to improving this page!)</p> -->

    <h2>Mission statement</h2>

    <p>The Stanford Languages Club is a platform for people to indulge their interest in foreign languages and in language-learning. We practice and develop a game-based suite of accelerated-language-acquisition techniques <i>Where Are Your Keys</i>. Through this system, people can learn languages from and teach languages to others primarily using concrete props, sign language, and a thrilling learning atmosphere rather than using rote memorization or translations. In addition, we provide a forum for appreciating the diversity of natural and constructed languages and the linguistic features they employ. We invite people of all studies to join us as long as they have a zest for language-learning, education, psychology, or linguistics.</p>

    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <p>We've done lots of languages in the past, and it looks like we're going to be doing French in the Fall!</p>

    <h2>Songs in various languages</h2>
